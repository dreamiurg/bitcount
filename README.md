# Bit counting

This small program measures and compares various bit counting algorithms.
It includes classic bit tests as well as hardware POPCNT, SIMD shuffling,
prefix-sum masking, deÂ Bruijn scans and large precomputed lookup tables.

More information about different approaches can be found in the following links:

## Project layout

```
bitcount.cpp           # benchmark driver
bitcount_algorithms.h  # declarations of the algorithms
bitcount_algorithms.cpp# implementations of the algorithms
bitcount_test.cpp      # simple correctness tests
Makefile               # build rules for the benchmark and tests
```

## Building and running

The repository provides a simple `Makefile`.

To build the benchmark and run it:

```sh
make bench
./bitcount        # runs the benchmark
```

To run the tests:

```sh
make test         # builds and executes bitcount_test
```

Use `make clean` to remove the generated binaries and object files.

Below are example timings obtained on a 2.26 GHz Core 2 Duo (gcc 4.2.1, `-O3`):

```
        8-bit lookup table calculation took 1.29 ms
        16-bit lookup table calculation took 2.08 ms
